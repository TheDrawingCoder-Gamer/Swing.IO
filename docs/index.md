# Swing.IO
Swing.IO is a library for the Typelevel ecosystem. It's meant to be an analog for Calico for JVM land. 

## Acknowlegements
*Swing.IO* is inspired by #[https://github.com/armanbilge/calico](Calico). It takes a lot of cues from it and from proposals of it. 

Thanks to @armanbilge for putting up with me in his chat and dealing with my questions.
