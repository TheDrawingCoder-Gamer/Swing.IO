# Swing.IO
Swing.IO is a library for the Typelevel ecosystem. It's meant to be an analog for Calico for JVM land. 

## Acknowlegements
**Swing.IO** is inspired by [Calico](https://github.com/armanbilge/calico). It takes a lot of cues from it and from proposals of it. 

Thanks to [@armanbilge](https://github.com/armanbilge) for putting up with me in his chat and dealing with my questions.
